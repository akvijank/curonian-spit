    <h1>The Curonian Spit</h1>
</header>
    <p>The Curonian Spit (Lithuanian: <i lang="lt">Kuršių nerija</i>; Russian: <i lang="rus" >Ку́ршская коса́</i> ;German: <i lang="deu">Kurische Nehrung</i>; Latvian: <i lang="lv">Kuršu kāpas</i>) is a 98-kilometre (61 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) long, thin, curved <strong>sand-dune spit</strong> that separates the Curonian Lagoon from the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea">Baltic Sea</a> coast. Its southern portion lies within Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia and its northern within southwestern Lithuania. It is a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site<a/> shared by the two countries.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>The Curonian Spit stretches from the Sambia Peninsula on the south to its northern tip next to a narrow strait, across which is the port city of Klaipėda on the mainland of Lithuania. The northern 52 <abbr title="kilometres">km</abbr> (32 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) long stretch of the Curonian Spit peninsula belongs to Lithuania, while the rest is part of the Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia. The width of the spit varies from a minimum of 400 <abbr title="metres">m</abbr> (1,300 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) in Russia (near the village of Lesnoy) to a maximum of 3,800 <abbr title="metres">m</abbr> (12,500 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>; 2.4 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) in Lithuania (just north of Nida).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Current state</h2>
    <p>The Curonian Spit is home to the highest moving (drifting) sand dunes in Europe. Their average height is 35 metres (115 ft), but some attain a height of 60 metres (200 ft). Several ecological communities are present on and near the Spit, from its outer beaches to dune ridges, wetlands, meadows, and forests. Its location on the East Atlantic Flyway means it is frequently visited by migratory waterfowl. Between 10 and 20 million birds fly over the feature during spring and fall migrations, and many pause to rest or breed there.</p>
    <p>Both the Russian and Lithuanian parts of the spit are national parks.</p>
    <p>The settlements of the Curonian Spit (from north to south) are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Smiltynė</li>
    <li>Alkstynė</li>
    <li>Juodkrantė</li>
    <li>Pervalka</li>
    <li>Preila</li>
    <li>Nida</li>
    <li>Morskoe</li>
    <li>Rybachy</li>
    <li>Lesnoy</li>
</ul>
    <p>The first six are on the Lithuanian side, while the last three are on the Russian side. The Russian side of the Curonian Spit belongs to Zelenogradsky District of the Kaliningrad Oblast, while the Lithuanian side is partitioned among Klaipėda city municipality and Neringa municipality.</p>
    <p>There is a single road that traverses the whole length of the Curonian Spit. In the Russian side it goes to Zelenogradsk, while on the Lithuanian side it goes to Smiltynė. The spit is not connected to mainland Lithuania. Car ferries provide a transportation link between Smiltynė, located on the spit, and the port town of Klaipėda.</p>
    <p>Since 2000, the Curonian Spit has been on UNESCO's World Heritage List under cultural criteria "V" (an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture, or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Tourism</h2>
    <p>The largest town on the spit is Nida in Lithuania, a popular holiday resort, mostly frequented by Lithuanian and German tourists. The northern shoreline of Curonian Spit is the site of beaches for tourists.</p>
<h3>Parnidis dune and sundial</h3>
    <p>Parnidis sand dune drifted by harsh winds is rising up to 52 <abbr title="metres">m</abbr> (171 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) above sea level.</p>
    <p>The interpretation of the name of Parnidis dune – local residents believe that the name comes from the phrase meaning “passed across Nida”, because this wind-blown dune has several times passed through the village of Nida. Scientists estimated that each person climbing or descending on the steep dune slopes moves several tons of sand, so hikers are only allowed to climb in designated paths.</p>
    <p>There is a granite sundial built on Parnidis dune in 1995 that accurately shows the time. The sundial was rebuilt in 2011 following storm damage. The sundial is a stone pillar 13.8 <abbr title="metres">m</abbr> (45 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) high and weighing 36 tonnes (35 long tons; 40 short tons). It consists in small steps covered with granite slabs, carved with hour and half-hour notches, as well as one notch for each month, and four additional notches for solstices and equinoxes. From the astronomical point of view Parnidis Dune is an ideal place for the sundial in Lithuania.</p>

<h2>Environmental concerns</h2>
    <p>There are environmental concerns related to the Curonian Spit, which is often promoted as a refuge of clean nature.</p>
    <p>Due to the importance of tourism and fishing for the regional economy, pollution of sea and coastlines may have disastrous effects for the area as the unique nature and the economy would be damaged.</p>
    <p>Moreover, increased tourism destroys the very nature that attracts it. For this reason, protective measures have been taken, such as banning tourists from hiking in certain areas of the spit.</p>
    <p>Natural hazards are more dangerous in the Curonian Spit than elsewhere in Lithuania or the Kaliningrad Oblast. For example, storms tend to be stronger there. Due to the importance of trees in preventing soil erosion, forest fires that happen in summer are more dangerous to the ecology.</p>
