    <p>The Curonian Spit (Lithuanian: <i lang="lt">Kuršių nerija</i>; Russian: <i lang="rus" >Ку́ршская коса́</i> ;German: <i lang="deu">Kurische Nehrung</i>; Latvian: <i lang="lv">Kuršu kāpas</i>) is a 98-kilometre (61 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) long, thin, curved sand-dune spit that separates the Curonian Lagoon from the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea">Baltic Sea</a> coast. Its southern portion lies within Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia and its northern within southwestern Lithuania. It is a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site<a/> shared by the two countries.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>The Curonian Spit stretches from the Sambia Peninsula on the south to its northern tip next to a narrow strait, across which is the port city of Klaipėda on the mainland of Lithuania. The northern 52 km (32 mi) long stretch of the Curonian Spit peninsula belongs to Lithuania, while the rest is part of the Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia. The width of the spit varies from a minimum of 400 m (1,300 ft) in Russia (near the village of Lesnoy) to a maximum of 3,800 m (12,500 ft; 2.4 mi) in Lithuania (just north of Nida).</p>
<h2>Geologic history</h2>
    <p>The Curonian Spit was formed about 3rd millennium BC.[1] A glacial moraine served as its foundation; winds and sea currents later contributed enough sand to raise and keep the formation above sea level.</p>
    <p>The existence of this narrow shoal is inherently threatened by the natural processes that govern shoreline features.[2] It depends on a dynamic balance between sand transport and deposition. If (hypothetically) the source area to the south-west were cut off, say, by a large port construction with a pier, the Spit would erode and eventually disappear. It is thus a geologically speaking ephemeral coast element. The most likely development, however, is that the shallow bay inside the Curonian Spit will eventually fill up with sediment, thus creating new land.</p>
<h2>Human history</h2>
    <h3>Mythology</h3>
        <p>According to Baltic mythology, the Curonian Spit was formed by a giantess, Neringa, who was playing on the seashore. This child also appears in other myths (in some of which she is shown as a strong young woman, similar to a female version of the Greek Heracles).</p>
    <h3>The Medieval period</h3>
        <p>From ca. 800 to 1016, the Spit was the location of Kaup, a major pagan trading centre which has not been excavated yet. The Teutonic Knights occupied the area in the 13th century, building their castles at Memel (1252), Neuhausen (1283), and at Rossitten (1372). The Spit may have been the home of the last living speaker of a now-extinct Baltic language, Old Prussian.</p>
    <h3>Kursenieki habitation</h3>
        <p>Significant human impacts on the area began in the 16th century.[1] Deforestation of the spit due to overgrazing, timber harvesting, and building of boats for the Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf in 1757 led to the dunes taking over the spit and burying entire villages. Alarmed by these problems, the Prussian government sponsored large-scale revegetation and reforestation efforts, which started in 1825. Other sources credit George David Kuwert, the owner of a post station in Nida in the late 19th century, with beginning the spit's reforestation.[citation needed] Owing to these efforts, much of the spit is now covered with forests.</p>
        <p>In the 19th century the Curonian Spit was inhabited primarily by Kursenieki, with a significant German minority in the south and a Lithuanian minority in the north. The population of Kursenieki eventually dwindled due to assimilation and other reasons; it is close to non-existent these days and had been even before 1945, when the spit had become ethnic German.</p>
